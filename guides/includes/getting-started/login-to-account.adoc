Let's now try to login to the account console to verify the user is configured correctly.

. Open the link:{authUrl}/realms/myrealm/account[Keycloak Account Console,window="_blank"]
. Login with `myuser` and the password you created earlier

You should now be logged-in to the account console where users can manage their accounts.
