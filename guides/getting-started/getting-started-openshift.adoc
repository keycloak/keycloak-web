## Before you start

Install https://code-ready.github.io/crc/[Red Hat Code Ready Containers] and follow the steps in the documentation to install a 
local OpenShift cluster.

Make sure the cluster is functional by executing the following command:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
crc status
----

If everything is OK you should see an output similar to this:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
CRC VM:          Running
OpenShift:       Running
...
----

Log in as the user `developer`:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc login -u developer -p developer
----

For this guide, we are going to create a new project called `keycloak`. For that, execute the following command:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc new-project keycloak
----

## Run Keycloak

To spin up a Keycloak server in your project, execute the following command:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc process -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keycloak/keycloak-quickstarts/latest/openshift-examples/keycloak.yaml \
    -p KEYCLOAK_USER=admin \
    -p KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin \
    -p NAMESPACE=keycloak \
| oc create -f -
----

Once the command above completes you should see a message similar to this:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
service/secure-keycloak created
route.route.openshift.io/keycloak created
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/keycloak created.
----

At this point, OpenShift is going to provision a Keycloak pod and related resources. As part of the process, OpenShift will
try to pull the Keycloak server image and this might take some time depending on your network connections in case the image is not
available yet.

To make sure Keycloak is provisioned, execute the following command:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc get pods
----

After a while you should see a message similar to this when the pod is ready:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
NAME                READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
keycloak-1-deploy   0/1       Completed   0          1h
keycloak-1-l9kdx    1/1       Running     0          1h
----

Once the server is provisioned, run the following command to find out the URLs of Keycloak:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
KEYCLOAK_URL=https://$(oc get route keycloak --template='{{ .spec.host }}')/auth &&
echo "" &&
echo "Keycloak:                 $KEYCLOAK_URL" &&
echo "Keycloak Admin Console:   $KEYCLOAK_URL/admin" &&
echo "Keycloak Account Console: $KEYCLOAK_URL/realms/myrealm/account" &&
echo ""
----

Remember these URLs as you will need them throughout this guide. The URL for the account console won't work
right now as you will need to create the realm first.
