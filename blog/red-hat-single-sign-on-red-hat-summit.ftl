<p>At Red Hat Summit this year there are no less than 4 sessions about Red Hat Single Sign-On! If you are going to Summit make sure to join us.</p>

<h3>OpenShift + single sign-on = Happy security teams and happy users</h3>

<p>Dustin Minnich, Joshua Cain, Jared Blashka, Brian Atkisson. Tuesday 4 PM.</p>

<p>One username and password to rule them all.</p>

<p>In this lab, we'll discuss and demonstrate single sign-on technologies and how to implement them using Red Hat products. We'll take you through bringing up an OpenShift cluster in a development environment, installing Red Hat single sign-on on top of it, and then integrating that with a variety of example applications.</p>

<h3>Securing service mesh, microservices, and modern applications with JSON Web Token (JWT)</h3>

<p>Stian Thorgersen, Sébastien Blanc. Wednesday 10:30 AM.</p>

<p>Sharing identity and authorization information between applications and services should be done with an open industry standard to ensure interoperability in heterogeneous environments. Javascript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) is a framework for securely sharing such information between heterogeneous applications and services.</p>

<p>In this session, we’ll cover the specifications of the JOSE framework, focusing especially on JSON Web Token (JWT). We’ll discuss practical applications of the JOSE framework, including relevant specifications, such as OpenID Connect. After this session, you’ll have an understanding of the specifications and how to easily adopt them using Red Hat single sign-on or another OpenID Connect provider.</p>


<h3>Red Hat single sign-on: Present and future</h3>

<p>Boleslaw Dawidowicz, John Doyle. Wednesday 3:30 PM.</p>

<p>Red Hat single sign-on (SSO) provides web SSO with modern, token-based protocols, such as OAuth and OpenID Connect. This session will highlight the features of the latest release and show the future direction of the technology within the Red Hat portfolio.</p>


<h3>Securing apps and services with Red Hat single sign-on</h3>

<p>Sébastien Blanc, Stian Thorgersen. Thursday 1:00 PM.</p>

<p>If you have a number of applications and services, the applications may be HTML5, server-side, or mobile, while the services may be monolithic or microservices, deployed on-premise or to the cloud. You may have started looking at using a service mesh. Now, you need to easily secure all these applications and services.</p>

<p>Securing applications and services is no longer just about assigning a username and password. You need to manage identities. You need two-factor authentication. You need to integrate with legacy and external authentication systems. Your list of other requirements may be long. But you don’t want to develop all of this yourself—nor should you.</p>

<p>In this session, we’ll demonstrate how to easily secure all your applications and services—regardless of how they're implemented and hosted—with Red Hat single sign-on. After this session, you'll know how to secure your HTML5 application or service, deployed to a service mesh and everything in between. Once your applications and services are secured with Red Hat single sign-on, you'll know how to easily adopt single sign-on, two-factor authentication, social login, and other security capabilities.</p>
