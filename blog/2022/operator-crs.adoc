A while back, we have https://www.keycloak.org/2021/10/keycloak-x-update.html#_operator_and_containers[announced] a new
Operator rewritten from scratch to provide the best experience for the Quarkus distribution. While the
https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-operator[legacy Operator] is now deprecated and
https://www.keycloak.org/2022/03/releases.html[will reach EOL with Keycloak 20], the
https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/tree/main/operator[new one] is already available as
a preview, see the https://www.keycloak.org/operator/installation[installation guide].

One of the most common concerns around the new Operator is the current lack of the CRDs for managing Keycloak resources,
such as realm, users and clients, in a cloud-native way. One of the key aspects of the new Operator will be redesign
of managing these Keycloak resources via CRs and git-ops. This new approach will leverage
the https://www.keycloak.org/2022/07/storage-map.html[new storage architecture] and future immutability options,
making the CRs the declarative single source of truth. In comparison to the legacy Operator, this will bring high robustness,
reliability, and predictability to the whole solution.

The new storage is still work in progress and currently is lacking some features like the file store to persist
data in a file instead of DB. Additionally, more features will have to be added to Keycloak, including but not limited to
a completely new concept of immutability which will be used to ensure any data coming from the CRs (and subsequently from
the file store) are read-only from the REST API, UI and other interfaces. All of this is critical to proper CRs implementation,
hence the new Operator is currently missing the CRDs for managing Keycloak resources. The missing CRDs will be added once
Keycloak has the necessary support for it, which is currently expected in Keycloak 21 (please note this is subject to
change).

In the meantime we have prepared a https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-k8s-resources/tree/operators-tandem[few workarounds]
in case the missing CRs are preventing you from giving the new Operator a try.
