We are glad to announce new certifications for Keycloak related to the https://openid.net/connect[OpenID Connect] and https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/#_fapi-support[FAPI]!
In the https://www.keycloak.org/2022/01/fapi[previous post], we announced certification of Keycloak 15.0.2 with the FAPI and Brazil Open Banking. This is a follow-up of this post
with the announcement of the additional certifications. Here are the details:

- Keycloak 18.0.0 is re-certified as OpenID Connect Provider. We already obtained certification for the OpenID Connect protocol a long time ago with the Keycloak 2.3.0. We now
re-certified all the existing configurations (Basic, Implicit, Hybrid, Config, Dynamic) with latest Keycloak 18.0.0 and added certification as a Form Post OP.
See the https://openid.net/certification/#OPs[OpenID Connect certifications page] for the details.

- Keycloak 18.0.0 is certified as OpenID Connect Logout Provider with all logout profiles (RP-Initiated OP, Session OP, Front-Channel OP, Backchannel OP).
See the https://openid.net/certification/#OPs[OpenID Connect certifications page (logout section)] for the details.

- Keycloak 15.0.2 is certified as https://consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/standards/#security-profile[Australia CDR], which is the extension based on existing
FAPI 1 Advanced Final certification, which Keycloak already obtained before. See the https://openid.net/certification/#FAPI_OPs[FAPI certifications page] for the details.

This milestone was achieved due the hard work of the awesome Keycloak community, who contributed lots of features related to OpenID Connect Protocol, OpenID Connect Logout and FAPI.
The special Thanks go to the https://github.com/keycloak/kc-sig-fapi/blob/main/members.adoc[FAPI-SIG], who helped a lot with the FAPI and OpenID Connect related features and especially
to https://github.com/tnorimat[Takashi Norimatsu], who is doing an awesome job for the Keycloak project.
