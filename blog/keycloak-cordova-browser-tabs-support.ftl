<p>
Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/gtudan">gtudan</a> we finally have support for browser tabs for Cordova in our JavaScript adapter. This enables using a system browser tab to do the login flows to Keycloak, which brings better security and also single sign-on and single sign-out to mobile applications secured with Keycloak.

This will be included in Keycloak 4.1.0.Final which will be released soon. In the meantime check this <a href="https://youtu.be/HKulxXDYJSs">screen-cast</a> to see this in action!
