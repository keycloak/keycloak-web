:summary: Help us understand your needs for SCIM support in Keycloak by participating in our survey!

We are targeting Keycloak 26.6 to start supporting System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM).

The initial scope have been defined in this https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/13484[issue],
but we want to ensure that we are addressing the most important use cases for our community.

In order to better understand your needs and use cases around SCIM, we would greatly appreciate your participation
in a brief survey. Your feedback will be invaluable in helping us to prioritize capabilities and ensure we are addressing
the use cases that matter most to you.

You can find the survey https://forms.gle/gq52TYHTQDyUQnDj8[here].
