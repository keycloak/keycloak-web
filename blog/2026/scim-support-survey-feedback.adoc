:summary: Let us keep you updated on our progress and share your feedback on SCIM support in Keycloak.

First of all, we want to thank everyone who took the time to fill out our survey on SCIM support in Keycloak.
Your feedback is invaluable to us as we work on implementing this feature. We are currently in the early stages of
development, and we are using your feedback to guide our efforts.

The survey results have shown us that there is a strong demand for SCIM support in Keycloak, and one of the most common
use case is to use Keycloak as a SCIM service provider to manage user provisioning and deprovisioning for external applications.
We are prioritizing this use case and driving the design and implementation of SCIM support in Keycloak to meet core set
of requirements for this use case.

In parallel, we are also exploring other use cases and requirements for SCIM support in Keycloak, such as using Keycloak
as a SCIM client to integrate with external identity providers. As a result of this initial work, we are implementing a
SCIM client that will allow in the future to address use cases where Keycloak can act as a SCIM client to integrate
external SCIM service providers.

That said, we have identified the initial scope for SCIM support in Keycloak targeting the 26.6 release, which will include the following capabilities:

* Expose realm users via the `/Users` endpoint with support for `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `GET`, and `DELETE` operations
* Expose realm groups via the `/Groups` endpoint with support for `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `GET`, and `DELETE` operations
* Support for a limited set of SCIM filters for querying resource types
* Support for pagination of results when querying resource types
* Support for fine-grained permissions to control access to SCIM resource types and operations based on realm admin roles and FGAP
* Support for bearer-token authorization

In regard to SCIM schemas, we are implementing support for the core SCIM schemas:

* `urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User`
* `urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Group`
* `urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:EnterpriseUser`

In regard to the `User` resource type, we are leveraging the User Profile feature to allow for flexible mapping of
realm user attributes to SCIM user attributes. It should be possible to support custom extensions to the `User` core schema
by defining custom user attributes and mapping them to SCIM user attributes via annotations in the attribute configuration
in the user profile.

In terms of schema validation, for now we are not respecting the metadata attributes in the SCIM schemas,
such as `required`, `mutability`, and `uniqueness`. However, for the `User` resource type, you should be able to leverage
the validations provided by the User Profile feature to enforce constraints on user attributes that are mapped
to SCIM user attributes.

In terms of integration, the survey shown that one of the key integrations we should be considering is with Microsoft Entra ID.
Sometimes is hard to us to test capabilities of Keycloak that rely on Entra ID, and we would also appreciate any early feedback
on nightly builds to ensure that we are on the right track in terms of meeting the requirements for this integration.

Last but not least, this work is also taking into account the amazing extensions (and their capabilities) that our
community is using today to provide SCIM support in Keycloak, such as the ones provided by:

* https://github.com/Captain-P-Goldfish/scim-for-keycloak
* https://github.com/Metatavu/keycloak-scim-server

With this in mind, we are delivering a `scim` module in the Keycloak codebase that should be flexible enough to allow
for custom extensions to be implemented on top of it.
