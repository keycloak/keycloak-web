:summary: Congratulations to Steven becoming an official Keycloak Maintainer

Although https://github.com/shawkins[Steven] has only been on the Keycloak team for a relatively short period of time he's managed to get the
https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/graphs/contributors[#15 place as the top contributor overall]. Now, if you narrow
that to the last two years he's in https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/graphs/contributors?from=06%2F01%2F2024[#3rd
place].

Steven is the go-to guy when it comes to the Operator where his knowledge is above most. He's also regularly helping out
the community, whether joining discussions, fixing bugs, or just generally making our distribution better for everyone.

Congratulations to Steven becoming an official Keycloak Maintainer.
