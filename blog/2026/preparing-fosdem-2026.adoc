== Meet the community at the Sovereign Identity stand

On Saturday, January 31st 2026, the Keycloak project will co-host the "`Sovereign Identity for server, desktop, and a cloud`" stand together with the FreeIPA, SSSD and OpenWallet project. We'll be open from 1000 in the morning until around 1800 in the early evening.

We will be at https://nav.fosdem.org/l/k1-c-02_sat/[K building on level 1 in group C]. Visit this stand to interact with the teams of several popular solutions in this space.

https://www.keycloak.org[Keycloak]:: Extensible self-hosted Single-Sign-On for your applications. Supporting Passkeys, OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, SAML 2.0 and Kerberos. Integrating with other Identity Providers through brokerage via SAML or OpenID Connect, or via LDAP.

https://www.freeipa.org[FreeIPA]:: Manage Linux users and client hosts in your realm from one central location, define Kerberos authentication and authorization policies for your identities, create mutual trust with other Identity Management systems. Issue certificates to your users and services.

https://sssd.io/[SSSD]:: Open Source Client for Enterprise Identity Management. Enroll your Linux machine into an Active Directory, FreeIPA or LDAP domain. Use remote identities, policies and various authentication and authorization mechanisms to access your computer.

https://openwallet.foundation/[OpenWallet Foundation]:: We drive global adoption of open, secure and interoperable digital wallet solutions. We set best practices for digital wallet technology through collaboration on standards-based OSS components that issuers, wallet providers and relying parties can use to bootstrap implementations that preserve user choice, security and privacy.

== Talks about Keycloak and related topics

FOSDEM is a big event divided into smaller, single-track conferences with their own call for papers and organizers. Submit by November 30th to be part it!

Here a short list of those dev rooms that might be of interest for you if you are into Keycloak:

https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/track/identity-and-access-management/[Identity and Access Management Devroom] (Sunday)::
This is all about identity, integration of identities and the various open source technologies available for that.
There are two Keycloak-related talks on the schedule:

https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/ATMQVL-intro-to-shared-signals-framework/[An Introduction to the OpenID Shared Signals Framework] by Thomas Darimont (Sunday, 09:05)::
As security threats become more sophisticated, the need for efficient, real-time communication between identity providers and relying parties is essential. The Shared Signals Framework (SSF) and related specifications such as CAEP and RISC address this challenge by providing a standardised way for systems to exchange security related signals, such as session revocations, credential breaches, and other identity-related incidents, in a secure and scalable manner. This talk introduces the Shared Signals Framework and explains how it enhances security and operational efficiency in modern identity ecosystems. We'll explore how SSF can be supported in Keycloak to enable real-time event-driven communication between providers and relying parties. Attendees will learn how Keycloak can help to detect and mitigate threats, and improve overall system security with SSF.
+
https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/ZRDQYN-keep-applications-secure-by-evolving-oidc-oauth2/[Keeping applications secure by evolving OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect] by Alexander Schwartz (Sunday, 10:05)::
OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect have been around for years to secure web and mobile applications alike with growing popularity.
+
To keep your applications and their data secure, these standards are evolving to align with security best practices.
+
Join this talk to see how the FAPI 2.0 Security Profile and the upcoming OAuth 2.1 standard promotes and enforces best practices, how to adapt your applications, and how Keycloak as an Open Source IAM can help you. Expect a demo and examples for some of the enhancements.
