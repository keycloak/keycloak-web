</p>
<p>
From now on, new larger Keycloak's features will be discussed in the open. For each new feature, a design document will be created and pushed to our Github repository as a simple MarkDown file. This will make it easy for everyone to comment as
well as contribute to the designs by opening Github issues and providing pull requests. 
We have already 3 documents open for discussion: 
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-community/blob/master/design/web-authn-two-factor.md">W3C Web Authentication - Two-Factor</a></li>

<h2>News from the Identity Management World</h2>
<p>
The big announcement, 2 weeks ago, was that <a href="https://www.yubico.com/webauthn/">WebAuthn<a/> became an official W3C Standard. This marks a milestone in the world of authentication and Identity Management. The goal of WebAuthn, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn">Wikipedia</a> is to :<i> standarize an interface for public-key authentication of users to web-based applications and services.</i>
The Keycloak community is of course really interested in this new standard, there is already a design document <a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-community/blob/master/design/web-authn-two-factor.md">available</a> and the community has even started to work on some <a href="https://github.com/webauthn4j/keycloak-webauthn-authenticator">prototype</a>
