For any Open Source project, it is important that any contributions contain code that can legally be contributed to the
project, and that the project has the right to distribute it under its license. There are many ways to achieve this,
where two popular approaches are Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) and Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

https://developercertificate.org/[Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)] is the most lightweight approach, which
requires contributors to sign-off on individual commits that are part of a contribution. This is easily done by using
the `--signoff` (`-s`) option when creating a commit. For example:

....
git commit -s -m "Description of the commit"
....

This adds a `Signed-off-by` statement at the end of the commit, where the contributor certifies they are following the
agreement laid out in the https://developercertificate.org/[Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)].

Contributor License Agreement (CLA), on the other hand, is a more complicated approach. As part of CLA, any contributors
are required to sign an upfront agreement with the project before making any contributions. This provides a higher
barrier for contributors, and also a higher cost for the Open Source Project as it has to maintain a list of approved
contributors with a corresponding maintained archive of agreements.

For Keycloak we decided to go with DCO as we believe it is much simpler both for contributors as well as maintainers.
