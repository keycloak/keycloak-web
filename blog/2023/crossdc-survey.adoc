The Keycloak and Infinispan engineering teams are working together to bring Cross-Site Replication (CSR) to a fully
supported state in future Keycloak releases, with Active/Passive support and Active/Active support.

We would like to gather inputs on your expectations, requirements, use-cases and sizing of the target deployment
environments for the CSR feature. Thanks in advance for filling out this survey form to help us better plan and deliver
this feature.

If your are interested in Active/Passive or Active/Active deployments of Keycloak please fill in
