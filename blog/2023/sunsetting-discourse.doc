Our community has grown and evolved significantly over time. This growth has 
been exciting to be a part of, but it has also presented new challenges. One of 
these challenges has been managing the multiple communication channels we 
have in place to engage with our community.

Today, we have various channels available: Google Groups, GitHub Discussions, 
Slack, and Discourse. Each of these platforms has its strengths in fostering the 
open dialogue and collaboration. However, we have been unable to provide the 
level of attention and interaction we believe our community deserves.

With this in mind, we have decided that as of June 26, 2023, we will sunset 
Discourse as one of our communication channels. We understand the value 
that Discourse has brought to our community, but we believe that focusing our 
efforts on fewer communication channels will allow us to foster more 
meaningful conversations.

What does this mean for Discourse users?

From June 26, 2023, users will no longer be able to create new posts on 
Discourse, but they can still access all the content and discussions that have 
been shared there. All the existing threads will be preserved as an archive, 
ensuring that the knowledge accumulated over the years is not lost.

For those who have been actively using Discourse, we understand that this 
transition might be challenging. We encourage users to join our conversations 
on https://www.keycloak.org/community[Google Groups, GitHub Discussions, and Slack].
