We would like to invite you to the Keycloak conference Keyconf 23!

The event will take place on June 16 in London. The details about this event together with the links for free registration are

We run the Keyconf conference along side a major conference https://whitehallmedia.co.uk/idmjun2023/[IDM Identity Management], which
takes place at the same place on June 15. So if you are interested in security in general, it is maybe an opportunity to join the both conferences together.
