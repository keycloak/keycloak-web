Back in June, we decided to sunset Discourse as one of our communication
channels, as outlined in our 
https://www.keycloak.org/2023/06/sunsetting-discourse.html[previous announcement].
However, after careful consideration and understanding the impact this decision
had on our community, we have chosen to revert it.

Firstly, we want to acknowledge that our first goal has always been to seek the
best for our community. While we strive to make the right decisions, we recognize
that we are not perfect. We apologize for any inconvenience our initial decision
may have caused, and appreciate the feedback received from many of you.

We are happy to announce that 
https://keycloak.discourse.group/u/dasniko[Niko] and 
https://keycloak.discourse.group/u/xgp[Garth] have kindly volunteered to moderate
Discourse. Their commitment makes it possible for us to reactivate the forum.
Without their support, especially given the multiple communication channels we
manage, this would not have been possible.

In the future, we will ensure to be transparent about decisions that impact our
users on Discourse. Thank you for your understanding, patience, and continued
support.

The Keycloak Team
