We have a lot of news to share in this second edition, so fasten your seatbelt and let's go!
</p>


<h2>News from the community</h2>
<p>
First of all, we would like to thank the whole community, which has contributed to this edition by sharing their links, tips, and so on.
</p>
<p>
  An increasing number of API Management/Gateway solutions can now be integrated with Keycloak. Recently, <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/">Ambassador</a>, an Open Source Kubernetes-Native API Gateway built on the Envoy Proxy, has added <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/reference/idp-support/keycloak/">support for Keycloak</a>; it has also published a <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/tutorials/github-sso/">quickstart</a> to show how Keycloak can be used to add Github as Identity provider.   
</p>
<p>
We have some good news for Python users. Akhil Lawrence has created a <a href="https://github.com/akhilputhiry/keycloak-client/releases">Python Keycloak Adapter Client</a>. Be sure to check out the really nice <a href="https://keycloak-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">documentation</a> that comes with many usage examples.  
</p>
<p>
Like any other project, setting up clustering can be somehow complex. Liqiang has shared with us his <a href="https://github.com/fit2anything/keycloak-cluster-setup-and-configuration">setup and configuration tips</a>. Thanks again for sharing your knowledge with the community!
</p>
<P>
The existing <a href="https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/keycloak">Keycloak Helm Chart</a> has now been deprecated and is now replaced by the <a href="https://github.com/codecentric/helm-charts">one</a> managed by CodeCentric.
</p>
<p>
Dmitry Telegin has created a really nice example on how you can dynamically brand your login theme for Keycloak. Check out the repository <a href="https://github.com/dteleguin/keycloak-dynamic-branding">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Hayri Cicek has written a nice introductory <a href="https://kodnito.com/posts/microprofile-jwt-with-keycloak/">article</a> on how to use Keycloak and MicroProfile. It even shows the usage of the brand new Client Scope "microprofile-jwt," which has been added in Keycloak 6.0.0.
</p>


<h2>News from the project</h2>
<p>
Keycloak 6.0.1 has been <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2019/04/keycloak-601-released.html">released</a>. We know that some people were a bit confused by our new versioning schema. We hope that this <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2019/04/versioning.html">blog post</a> will clear it up. 
</p>
<p>
We started the proposal process for Keycloak to be accepted into the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). We hope that this effort will significantly boost our community adoption with our ultimate goal of becoming the de facto solution for OAuth2/OpenID Connect within Open Source and Cloud Native.
You can watch the presentation to the CNCF TOC (Technical Oversight Committee) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBrmcH9VFYE&feature=youtu.be&t=1032">here</a> and the slides are also available <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bijEpuwaaa6jR1D5PAjyW731-j6Xc1TFHJuUh_FwwK8/edit?ts=5ca774e9#slide=id.g5628e016b1_15_112">here</a>.   
<p>

<h2>Contributing to Keycloak</h2>

<p>We always welcome contributions to Keycloak. If you would like to contribute and have a great idea, tell us about it
on the developer mailing list. If you are unsure about what to work on, let us know and we can help!</p>

<p>As a first time contributor, you may have a simpler idea to start, such as contributing a bug fix. This type of contribution will allow you to get to know the code base, the test suite, and the mechanics of creating a pull request. You can find a list of <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20Keycloak%20AND%20issuetype%20%3D%20bug%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%20%22Awaiting%20Volunteers%22%20">open bugs here</a>.</p>

<p>We also have a list of <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20Keycloak%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%20%22Awaiting%20Volunteers%22%20">open issues</a> that
are awaiting contributions. Not all issues are properly reviewed, so we recommend that you start by sending an email to the developer mailing list before you begin.</p>

<p>
For each newsletter, we will also highlight a few features for which we would especially like contributions. These features include:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-953">Allow user to delete account</a> - In light of GDPR and the right to be forgotten a very useful feature is to allow users to delete their own accounts.</li>
