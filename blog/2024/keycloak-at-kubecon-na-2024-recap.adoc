Keycloak had a very active presence at this year's KubeCon NA in Salt Lake City, Utah. This blog presents a few of the
highlights as well as ways you can contribute to Keycloak’s CNCF journey.

== Project Pavillion

Keycloak hosted a project pavilion stand during Wednesday, Thursday and Friday afternoon slots. Attending the booth were
Keycloak contributors https://github.com/y-tabata[Yoshiyuki Tabata] from Hitachi and https://github.com/ryanemerson[Ryan Emerson],
https://github.com/mabartos[Martin Bartos] and https://github.com/kami619[Kamesh Akella] from Red Hat.

During these sessions we discussed all things Keycloak with existing and prospective users, as well as provided the much
requested Keycloak stickers plus additional swag for particularly enthusiastic users. It was great to hear war stories
from the trenches with regards to both the good and bad of Keycloak. This feedback is essential for us to continue to
evolve the project and plan the future roadmap. A special thanks to all of those who filled out our survey forms, we
really appreciate your time. If you were unable to attend the pavilion, please consider filling out the
http://bit.ly/keycloak-community[online version of the form].

== Keycloak Talk

https://github.com/ryanemerson[Ryan Emerson] and https://github.com/kami619[Kamesh Akella] presented a talk titled
“Running a Highly Available Identity and Access Management with Keycloak”. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDFWBQO31M4[Watch the recording]
to hear about the recent developments in Keycloak’s HA story, including an overview of the architecture recommended in
the Keycloak guides, the lessons learned during the development of said guides and the CNCF technologies used as part of
