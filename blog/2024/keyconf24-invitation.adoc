KeyConf23 was an incredible success, bringing together nearly 60 passionate members of the Keycloak community in London. The energy and collaboration were palpable as attendees
delved into the latest developments in identity and access management. We witnessed thought-provoking discussions, learned from industry experts, and forged valuable connections.

Building on that momentum, we're thrilled to announce KeyConf24, our 2024 Keycloak Identity Summit! This year's event promises to be even bigger and better, with a program packed
full of relevant, cutting-edge topics.
