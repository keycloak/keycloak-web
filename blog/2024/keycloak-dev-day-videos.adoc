Back in February this year, we (https://github.com/srose[Sebastian] and https://wwwn-k.de[me (Niko)]) hosted the very first edition of https://keycloak-day.dev[Keycloak DevDay] - _a one-day, community-driven conference_ - in Frankfurt/Main, Germany.
The event was a blast and completely sold-out, plus many additional participants online in the two parallel live streams.
We were able to welcome attendees from all over Europe.
Thank you all for being part of this incredible event! üôè
