We (https://github.com/srose[Sebastian] and https://www.n-k.de[me (Niko)]) are exited to announce the next edition of **Keycloak DevDay!**

== Save the Date

DevDay is taking place in **Darmstadt, Germany** at **March, 6th 2025**.

It will be again a 1-day conference with talks, panels, discussions and an OpenSpace/Unconference format, with lots of opportunities for networking and exchange among like-minded people.
Of course, there will also be plenty of drinks 🥤🍹 and food 🍔🌮🥗, as well as an exclusive surprise gift 🎁 for all participants.

== Call for Papers

The https://keycloak-day.dev[CallForPapers 📝 is already open] (approx. until mid of October). If you would like to submit a talk proposal, you should not wait too long, as we will regularly review and publish the submitted proposals. So submitting early gives you the best chance of being part of the next DevDay!

Ticket sales 🎟️ will start in mid-September.
This time, there will be more tickets available than at the first edition.
