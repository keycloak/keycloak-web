# New Repository

We're excited to announce that the Keycloak Terraform Provider has officially moved under the Keycloak organization! 
You can find the new repository https://github.com/keycloak/terraform-provider-keycloak[here].

# The Journey So Far

Thanks to https://www.keycloak.org/2024/09/realm-config-management-tools-survey-results.html[our community survey], we confirmed that the Keycloak Terraform Provider by mrparkers is the most widely used tool 
for realm configuration management. The move to the Keycloak organization is a natural next step in making this essential 
tool a core part of the Keycloak ecosystem.

## Gratitude and Transition

A huge thank-you to https://github.com/mrparkers[mrparkers] for creating and maintaining the provider. Your contributions have been invaluable to the community. 
The new maintainers, https://github.com/sschu[Sebastian Schuster] and https://github.com/thomasdarimont[Thomas Darimont], will ensure the project continues to thrive.

# Migration Notes

You'll need to update your configurations to migrate to the Keycloak-hosted Terraform Provider. Check out https://github.com/keycloak/terraform-provider-keycloak#migration-to-the-new-provider[our migration guide],
