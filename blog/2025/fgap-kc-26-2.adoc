:summary: Keycloak's latest release introduces new suported version of long-in-preview feature fine-grained admin permissions.

For years, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) has been the cornerstone of authorization in many applications. Assigning users to roles 
provides a simple and effective way to manage access for common use cases. However, as applications become more complex and security 
requirements more demanding, RBAC alone often falls short.

Keycloak is leveling up administrative access control with the release of **Fine Grained Admin Permissions V2** a major step towards 
introducing delegated administration to Keycloak so that server administrators can assign management privileges to other users 
in a realm. By doing that, you should be able to reduce management costs and effort, and improve the overall efficiency and security 
of your deployments by authorizing access to specific resources in a realm.

## Why Fine-Grained Admin Permissions (FGAP) V2?

In previous Keycloak versions, administrative access was largely driven by broad roles such as `realm-admin` or `manage-users`. 
While effective for simple setups, these roles often granted more access than necessary and lacked clarity around which actions 
they allowed.

*FGAP V2* introduces a cleaner, more deliberate permission model that enables:

- *Granular access control* over users, clients, groups, and roles
- *Clear boundaries* between operations‚Äîno more implicit permissions
- *Easier management* of the permissions and policies
- *Better evaluation mechanism* to allow authorization administrators audit the model 

## ‚ú® Key Highlights

### üß≠ Centralized Permissions Management

A new *Permissions* section in the Admin Console provides a single place to view and manage all fine-grained permissions for a realm. 
This simplifies navigation and makes it easier to design and audit your permission model.

### üîç Improved Manageability and Evaluation

Permissions are now easier to discover, filter, and evaluate. You can inspect which scopes are assigned to which identities‚Äîmaking 
it more transparent and manageable to build tailored administrative roles.

### üéØ Resource-Specific and Global Permissions

Define permissions either at the individual resource level (e.g., a single or set of users or clients), or across all resources 
of a given type (e.g., all groups). This dual mode offers flexibility for both tightly scoped delegation and broader administrative 
policies.

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Explicit Operation Scoping

Gone are the days of hidden dependencies between permissions. FGAP V2 makes every scope explicit‚Äîsuch as `view-members`, `manage-members`, 
`map-roles`, or `impersonate`. This reduces confusion and gives you full visibility into what's granted and why.

### üõ†Ô∏è Per-Realm Enablement

FGAP V2 can be enabled independently for each realm. This allows administrators to adopt the new model incrementally, experiment 
safely, and customize permission boundaries realm-by-realm.

## üîß How to Enable It

1. Start Keycloak. The feature is enabled by default.
2. Go to *Realm Settings ‚Üí Admin Permissions* and enable FGAP for the realm.
3. Use the new *Permissions* section to define permissions and policies for users, clients, groups, and roles.

For full configuration details, refer to the https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#_fine_grained_permissions[Fine-Grained Admin Permissions documentation].

## üîÑ Migration and Compatibility

FGAP V2 provides the same level of access control over realm resources as the previous version, while improving manageability and 
clarity. Automatic migration is not available, but if you're upgrading from an earlier Keycloak version, see the 
https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/upgrading/index.html#migrating-to-26-2-0[Upgrading Guide] for important key changes and migration notes.

## What‚Äôs Next?

This is just the beginning. Upcoming Keycloak releases will continue to expand FGAP support to additional resource types (such as 
Organizations) and more fine grained actions for existing resources.
