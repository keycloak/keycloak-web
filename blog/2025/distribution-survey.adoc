The different ways of distribution – be it the Operator, container images, or plain ZIP file – play a pivotal role in all Keycloak deployments.
It is often the first touchpoint for users and sets the tone for their overall experience. The selected distribution method
then affects the whole lifecycle of the deployment – upgrades, scaling, configuration, and more.

As we continue to evolve Keycloak to better serve cloud native environments, we are seeking your valuable input to understand your
preferences and requirements regarding Keycloak distribution and deployment methods. Help us shape the cloud native future of Keycloak
by participating in our survey! You can find the survey https://forms.gle/su5jbfqWCNYNMCKb9[here].
