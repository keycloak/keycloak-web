Keycloak runs in a lot of regions and countries.
Translations help Keycloak to reach a wider audience by making the platform usable for speakers of various languages.

For translations, https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/keycloak/#languages[Keycloak now integrates with Weblate] to simplify the process.
The community can use a web-based frontend to contribute translations, and the language maintainers get automated notifications and review the translations.

*Join us in the two upcoming episodes of Keycloak Hour of Code* (https://www.meetup.com/keycloak-hour-of-code/events/307123328[AMER/EMEA time zone on Apr 14] or https://www.meetup.com/keycloak-hour-of-code/events/307123354[APAC time zone on Apr 15]) to see it live and in action, and to ask your questions.

Read on for more details on the process.

== Translate using Weblate

https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/blob/main/docs/translation.md#using-weblate-to-to-update-translations[Weblate eliminates the need for Git skills;] and browsers suffice for translation contributions.

Two language maintainers are needed to set up a translation for Keycloak in Weblate.
They need to be native speakers of that language and will regularly review the contributions from the community.
Today this is the case https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/keycloak/#languages[for languages like Catalan, German, Dutch, Italian, Japanese and Spanish].

To have your language added to Weblate, https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/discussions/9270[join the GitHub discussion on translations] and pair up with others.

== Translate using GitHub pull requests

Before Weblate, we used GitHub pull requests to contribute and maintain all translations,
https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/blob/main/docs/translation.md#using-github-pull-requests-to-update-translations[and you can still use them].

Each pull request for a translation needs to be reviewed by a native speaker.
You can either ask the community, a friend or a colleague for the review.
