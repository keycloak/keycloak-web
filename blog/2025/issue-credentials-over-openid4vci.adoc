:summary: Keycloak can act as a verifiable credential issuer using OpenID4VCI, allowing users to receive verifiable credentials as digital proofs of identity. This guide walks through the required configuration steps.

Before configuring Keycloak, it is helpful to understand its role in decentralized identity ecosystems. As a verifiable credential issuer, Keycloak can issue digitally signed credentials using the https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html[OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance] (OpenID4VCI) protocol, allowing relying parties (also known as verifiers) to independently verify them without contacting the issuer.

Keycloak implements OpenID4VCI, enabling the issuance of verifiable credentials (VCs) as digital proofs of identity or attributes. Configuring this functionality requires consistent setup across the realm, clients, and issuable credentials (client scopes).

For example, consider the following scenario: The https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-oauth-sig[Keycloak OAuth SIG team] wants to issue verifiable membership credentials to its members, including their name and email, which can later be presented at onsite or virtual events as proof of active membership.

NOTE: At the time of writing this blog, Keycloak's support for OpenID4VCI is still experimental. This guide uses the https://www.keycloak.org/nightly/[**nightly release**] which builds from the main branch. The feature is expected to be promoted to preview in early 2026.

== Introduction to OpenID4VCI & OpenID4VP

OpenID4VCI is a protocol developed by the OpenID Foundation that extends the OAuth 2.0 framework to support the secure and interoperable issuance of Verifiable Credentials (VCs). VCs are digital, tamper-evident representations of information, such as identity attributes or qualifications, which can be cryptographically verified without needing to contact the issuer at verification time.

While this guide primarily focuses on **OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OpenID4VCI)**, the overall trust architecture also includes **OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OpenID4VP)**, which governs how holders present credentials to verifiers. Together, these protocols enable decentralized identity ecosystems in which users (holders) retain control of their data and can share it selectively with verifiers.

.Triangle of trust or Issuer-Holder-Verifier model
image::${blogImages}/openid4vci/triangle-of-trust.png[alt="Triangle of trust or Issuer-Holder-Verifier model", align=center, width=800]

In this model:

- **Issuer ↔ Holder** interactions are governed by **OpenID4VCI**, covering credential issuance.
- **Holder ↔ Verifier** interactions are governed by **OpenID4VP**, covering credential presentation and verification.

From a privacy perspective, this separation of concerns is fundamental. By decoupling **credential issuance** from **credential presentation**, issuers are unable to track where, when, or how a holder uses their credentials. This architecture prevents correlation and profiling, and ensures that users remain in control of how their data is shared.

=== Why Use OpenID4VCI

The primary motivations for adopting OpenID4VCI include:

- **Interoperability**: Builds on established OpenID Connect (OIDC) standards, simplifying integration with existing identity providers.
- **Privacy and Security**: Supports selective disclosure (e.g., proving age without revealing birthdate) and offline verification.
- **Compliance**: Aligned with regulations like eIDAS 2.0.
- **Efficiency**: Leverages OIDC mechanisms to streamline issuance while maintaining trust in the "triangle of trust" model (Issuer-Holder-Verifier).

=== Verifiable Credential Formats

OpenID4VCI supports multiple credential formats, which define how verifiable credentials are encoded and issued.

- https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc-13.html[SD-JWT VC] – Selective Disclosure JSON Web Token Verifiable Credential
- https://identity.foundation/jwt-vc-presentation-profile/[JWT VC] – JSON Web Token Verifiable Credential
- https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html[mDL/mdoc] – Mobile driver’s license / mobile document format

These formats allow issuers to provide portable, verifiable digital proofs that support selective disclosure and offline verification in decentralized identity ecosystems.

*Keycloak currently supports both SD-JWT VC and JWT VC for issuance*, while mDL/mdoc listed above is part of the OpenID4VCI specification.

=== Concrete Use-Cases Enabled by OpenID4VCI

Verifiable credentials open a variety of real-world applications. Examples include:

- Governments or non-government organisations issuing digital identity cards or driver’s licenses that citizens can present when booking hotels, opening bank accounts, or accessing public services, while revealing only the information necessary for the transaction (e.g., age or residency) without exposing full personal details.
- City councils issuing verifiable birth certificates that universities and hospitals can validate without a central lookup.
- Universities issuing digital diplomas that employers can instantly verify for authenticity.
- Companies issuing employee badges as verifiable credentials for office access or remote authentication.
- Event organizers issuing verifiable tickets that can be validated offline.
- Professional associations issuing membership credentials such as in our OAuth SIG example for verifying access to gated resources or conference venues.
- Digital movie or event tickets that are tamper-evident and can be verified offline.

These examples illustrate the variety of situations where verifiable credentials remove the need for direct communication between verifier and issuer while preserving trust.

=== Key Flows in OpenID4VCI

OpenID4VCI defines two primary flows for credential issuance: the **Authorization Code Flow** and the **Pre-Authorized Code Flow**. These flows determine how a wallet (holder’s application) obtains an access token to request a VC from the issuer.

==== Authorization Code Flow

The Authorization Code Flow is **interactive** and requires the holder to authenticate and consent at the issuer’s authorization endpoint. It is ideal for scenarios where explicit user approval is required, or additional claims must be collected.

**Steps:**

1. The **Wallet** sends an Authorization Request to the **Issuer’s Authorization Endpoint**, requesting credentials.
2. The **Issuer** authenticates the **User** and requests consent for the issuance.
3. The **User** provides credentials and grants consent.
4. The **Issuer** returns an **Authorization Code** to the Wallet.
5. The **Wallet** exchanges the code at the **Issuer Token Endpoint** for an **Access Token**.
6. The **Issuer** returns the **Access Token** to the Wallet.
7. The **Wallet** requests the **Verifiable Credential** from the **Issuer Credential Endpoint** using the Access Token.
8. The **Issuer** returns the **VC** to the Wallet.

==== Pre-Authorized Code Flow

The Pre-Authorized Code Flow is **non-interactive**. The issuer pre-authenticates and authorizes the user, providing a **pre-authorized code** (often via QR code). It is faster and suitable for pre-approved credential issuance.

**Steps:**

1. The **Issuer** provides a **Pre-Authorized Code** to the **Wallet** (e.g., via QR code or link).
2. The **Wallet** exchanges the code at the **Issuer Token Endpoint** for an **Access Token**.
3. The **Issuer** returns the **Access Token** to the Wallet.
4. The **Wallet** requests the **Verifiable Credential** from the **Issuer Credential Endpoint** using the Access Token.
5. The **Issuer** returns the **VC** to the Wallet.

.Credential issuance via Pre-Authorized Code Flow

Now that we have covered the technical flows, the rest of this guide walks through configuring Keycloak to issue verifiable credentials using the *Pre-Authorized Code Flow*, including realm, client scope, and client-level setup.

== Configuring Keycloak for OpenID4VCI

OpenID4VCI in Keycloak is offered via the feature flag `oid4vc-vci`, which consequently needs to be enabled at startup.

[source,bash]
----
--features=oid4vc-vci
----

That said, we now assume that you have a running Keycloak instance with the `oid4vc-vci` feature flag enabled.

Beyond enabling the feature flag, the following configuration steps need to be taken consistently, in accordance with your use case:

- Configure OpenID4VCI at the realm level
- Configure an issuable verifiable credential (as a dedicated client scope)
- Enable and configure OpenID4VCI at the client level

=== Configuring OpenID4VCI at the realm level

Let's assume you have already created a realm named `oauth-sig-realm` to represent the OAuth SIG group, and that a couple of users have also been created in this realm, each with a password assigned, to represent members of the group.

In addition, any user who is intended to create credential offers must be granted the built-in `credential-offer-create` role. This role is provided by the OpenID4VCI extension and does not need to be created manually. Assigning it ensures that only authorized users can generate credential offers, maintaining the security of the issuance process.

.Screenshot: Realm and Users
image::${blogImages}/openid4vci/screenshot-realm-and-users.png[alt="Screenshot: Realm and Users", align=center, width=800]

The behavior of OpenID4VCI across the entire realm can be modulated via realm attributes.
On the Admin Console, find the *OID4VCI Attributes* section under the *Realm Settings > Tokens* tab.

.Screenshot: OID4VCI Attributes
image::${blogImages}/openid4vci/screenshot-realm-config-oid4vci-attributes.png[alt="Screenshot: OID4VCI Attributes", align=center, width=800]

Sensible defaults apply out of the box, but for the sake of this demo, we would want, for instance, to increase the value of **Pre-Authorized Code Lifespan** to 3 minutes so that the issuance flow expires less quickly.
To learn more about the **Nonce Lifetime** and other realm attributes for OpenID4VCI, please refer to the main https://www.keycloak.org/docs/nightly/server_admin/index.html#_oid4vci[Keycloak documentation].

Lastly, because EC cryptography is highly encouraged in the OpenID4VC ecosystem, we also invite you to add a *P-256 Elliptic Curve key pair* to the realm's set of keys under *Realm Settings > Keys > Providers*.
This will later enable configuring the signing of issued VCs with algorithm `ES256`.

=== Configuring an issuable verifiable credential (as a dedicated client scope)

Different credential types can be configured for issuance depending on what data the credential should embed, what format it should have, or other criteria.
Each credential type is configured as a dedicated client scope of protocol type "OpenID for Verifiable Credentials".

We will configure our membership credential to be issued as an SD-JWT credential carrying a user's first name, last name, and email.
Each claim to be added to the credential requires a corresponding protocol mapper from the User Model to the credential.
Other fields such as the time of issuance or a unique identifier for the credential are supported via other types of protocol mappers.

=== Configure the Membership Credential Client Scope

Create a new client scope named `membership-credential` with the following attributes:

[cols="3,3,6",options="header"]
|===
| Setting | Value | Description

| *Include in Token Scope*
| Enabled
| Ensures the scope is included in issued tokens.

| *Token JWS Type*
| `dc+sd-jwt`
| Defines the JWS envelope format for the credential.

| *Signing Key ID*
| `<kid-of-key-created-earlier>`
| Select the ES256 key previously created.

| *Credential Display*
| `[{"name": "OAuth SIG Membership", "locale":"en"}]`
| Defines how the credential is displayed in a wallet.

| *Verifiable Credential Type (VCT)*
| `https://credentials.example.com/oauth-sig-membership`
| Specifies the `vct` value of the credential.

| *Credential Signing Algorithms*
| `ES256`
| Defines the credential signing algorithms.
|===

NOTE: All other settings not listed in this table should be left at their default values.

== Configure Protocol Mappers

Navigate to *Mappers → Configure a new mapper*.

Follow the configuration in the table below to create all required mappers for this demo.

=== Mapper Configuration

[cols="3,3,3,3,3",options="header"]
|===
| Mapper Type | Mapper Name | Claim Name | User Attribute / Source | Display Metadata

| *User Attribute Mapper*
| given_name-mapper
| `given_name`
| `firstName`
| `[{"name":"Given Name","locale":"en"}]`

| *User Attribute Mapper*
| family_name-mapper
| `family_name`
| `lastName`
| `[{"name":"Family Name","locale":"en"}]`

| *User Attribute Mapper*
| email-mapper
| `email`
| `email`
| `[{"name":"Email","locale":"en"}]`

// iat-mapper has a different structure
| *Issuance Date Claim Mapper*
| iat-mapper
| `iat`
| *Truncate:* `HOURS` + *Source:* `COMPUTE`
| _No display entries_
|===

.Screenshot: Adding User Attribute Mapper
image::${blogImages}/openid4vci/add-user-attribute-mapper.png[alt="Screenshot: Adding User Attribute Mapper", align=center, width=800]

Repeat this process for each mapper listed above.

After all mappers are added, your mapper list should look similar to this:

.Screenshot: Mappers Registered
image::${blogImages}/openid4vci/protocol-mappers-registered.png[alt="Screenshot: Mappers Registered", align=center, width=800]

To learn more about additional configuration attributes or mapper options, refer to the main https://www.keycloak.org/docs/nightly/server_admin/index.html#create-client-scopes-with-mappers[Keycloak documentation].

Verify that the client scope was created successfully by checking the Admin Console under *Client Scopes*. 

Additionally, check the Credential Issuer Metadata Endpoint by navigating to **Realm Settings**, toggling the **Verifiable Credentials** option, and saving the changes. Once done, the endpoint will be listed, allowing you to verify that the newly created credential type appears among the issuable credentials, as shown below.

.Screenshot: Enable Verifiable Credentials in Realm Settings
image::${blogImages}/openid4vci/screenshot-realm-verifiable-credentials.png[alt="Enable Verifiable Credentials in Realm Settings", align=center, width=800]

The credential type should appear in the metadata like the following:

[source,json5]
----
{
  // ...
  "credential_configurations_supported": {
    "membership-credential": {
      "id": "membership-credential",
      "format": "dc+sd-jwt",
      "scope": "membership-credential",
      "cryptographic_binding_methods_supported": [
        "jwk"
      ],
      "credential_signing_alg_values_supported": [
        "ES256"
      ],
      "vct": "https://credentials.example.com/oauth-sig-membership",
      // ...
    }
  }
  // ...
}
----

=== Enabling OpenID4VCI at the client level

Next, let's create a new client in the `oauth-sig-realm` realm to represent an application that members of the OAuth SIG will use to request and receive their membership credentials.
We will name this client `oauth-sig-client` and configure it as a standard OpenID Connect client.

During client creation, make sure to check the **Direct Access Grants** box, as we will use the *Resource Owner Password Credentials* flow to obtain a user access token in a later step. All other fields are left unchanged.

.Screenshot: Client Creation
image::${blogImages}/openid4vci/screenshot-client-creation.png[alt="Screenshot: Client Creation", align=center, width=800]

One important point to note is that clients must explicitly enable OpenID4VCI to be able to use it.
Navigate to the *Advanced* tab of the `oauth-sig-client` client and toggle the **Enable OID4VCI** switch under the *OpenID for Verifiable Credentials* section.

.Screenshot: Enable OID4VCI on Client
image::${blogImages}/openid4vci/screenshot-client-enable-oid4vci.png[alt="Screenshot: Enable OID4VCI on Client", align=center, width=800]

Finally, we need to assign the previously created `membership-credential` client scope to the `oauth-sig-client` client. To do this, navigate to the **Client Scopes** tab of the `oauth-sig-client` client and add `membership-credential` as an **Optional Client Scope**.

.Screenshot: Assigning membership-credential client scope to the client
image::${blogImages}/openid4vci/screenshot-assign-credential-type-to-client.png[alt="Assigning membership-credential client scope to the client", align=center, width=800]

== Obtaining a User Access Token

Before obtaining the user access token, ensure that the user has the `credential-offer-create` role, as only users with this role can create credential offers.

With the client configured and the user's password set, we can now request a *user access token*. This token will later be used to authorize the credential offer request.

[source,sh]
----
USER_TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST "http://<keycloak.instance>/realms/oauth-sig-realm/protocol/openid-connect/token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=<user-username>" \
  -d "password=<user-password>" \
  -d "grant_type=password" \
  -d "client_id=oauth-sig-client" | jq -r '.access_token' )
echo "User Access Token obtained: $USER_TOKEN"
----

Now that we have a *user access token* issued to the user with the `credential-offer-create` role, we can use it to request a credential offer from the issuer in the next step.

== Retrieving a credential offer to start the issuance flow

For Pre-Authorized Code flows, OpenID4VCI issuance can be initiated by retrieving a credential offer from Keycloak at the Credential Offer Endpoint. The endpoint requires a valid user access token and the username of the target user for whom the pre-authorized offer will be generated. 
In our case, we will be using the same user for both credential offer creation and retrieval.

[source,sh]
----
curl -X GET "http://<keycloak.instance>/realms/oauth-sig-realm/protocol/oid4vc/credential-offer-uri?credential_configuration_id=membership-credential&type=qr-code&username=<username>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER_TOKEN" \
  --output credential-offer-qr.png
----

NOTE: Replace `<username>` with the user you created earlier.
The QR code image is saved as `credential-offer-qr.png`. Open this file and use your wallet to redeem the credential.

With the query parameter `type=qr-code`, the endpoint returns a *direct binary representation of the QR code image*. If omitted, the endpoint returns JSON, which requires extra steps to construct the QR code from the offer data.

.QR Code Generation Overview

Upon scanning the QR code with a compatible wallet, a membership credential is issued to the requesting user.

=== ⚠️ Wallet Compatibility Notice

Keycloak implements the **final OpenID4VCI specification** and includes a limited **Draft-15 compatibility patch** with partial support.

Tested Draft-15 wallets that work with the compatibility patch:

[cols="1,1", options="header"]

== Before You Go

In this blog post, we have illustrated how to set up Keycloak for issuing verifiable credentials over OpenID4VCI, using a simple scenario of issuing membership credentials to members of the https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-oauth-sig[Keycloak's OAuth SIG group].
We covered the necessary configuration steps at the realm, client scope, and client levels, and demonstrated how to retrieve a credential offer to initiate the issuance flow.
If you are looking into streamlining this configuration process for OpenID4VCI in Keycloak, take a look at our https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-oauth-sig/tree/main/oid4vci-deployment#readme[OID4VCI Deployment] project, which has solid examples for both the preauthorization and authorization code flows.
