BRZ migrated the Austrian Business Service Portal with 2M+ users to Keycloak.

The Austrian Business Service Portal (USP) is the central online eGovernment platform for entrepreneurs and businesses. It connects businesses with various Austrian online government services, where businesses can access all digital services and information in one place.

The USP was launched in 2010 by the https://www.brz.gv.at/en/[Austrian Federal Computing Center] (BRZ, abbreviated from the German name Bundesrechenzentrum). The BRZ is the market-leading eGovernment partner of the Austrian federal administration and is both developing and operating the portal.
