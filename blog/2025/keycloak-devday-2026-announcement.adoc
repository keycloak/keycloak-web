We (Niko and me (Sebastian)) are excited to announce the next edition of Keycloak DevDay!
DevDay is expanding to a **2-day event** taking place again in Darmstadt, Germany on **March 5th and 6th, 2026**.

The location is about 30 minutes away from Frankfurt/Main Airport by public transport, see https://www.keycloak-day.dev[] for details.

== What's New for 2026?

Keycloak DevDay - **the Keycloak community conference** - expands to exciting two days:

**Day 1 (February 5th)** - Traditional Conference Format::
Full day of talks, presentations, and panels featuring maintainers, industry-leading speakers, and community experts.
Dive deep into Keycloak developments, best practices, real-world use cases, and the latest innovations in and around Keycloak.

**Day 2 (February 6th)** - Unconference & Open Space::
Interactive format shaped entirely by YOU, the participants! Join fellow Keycloakers in an Unconference/Open Space environment where you can:
- Pitch your own topics and ideas
