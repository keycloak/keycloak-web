:summary: Keycloak 26.2 brings Token Exchange out of preview with an officially supported version compliant with OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange specification.

The Token Exchange feature has been available in Keycloak for a long time, but only as a preview feature. With the release of
**Keycloak 26.2**, we're happy to share that **Standard Token Exchange is now officially supported** and fully compliant with https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8693[OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange (RFC 8693)].

== What is Token Exchange? 🔄

Token Exchange is a mechanism that allows a client to exchange one token for another. In the context of Keycloak, this means a client can exchange a token originally issued for another client and receive a new token issued specifically for itself.

Token Exchange is especially helpful in these scenarios:

=== 🎯 Different Audience
When a token was issued for one service but needs to be used to access another, Token Exchange can issue a new token with the appropriate audience.

=== 🔐 Scoped Permissions
If a client needs to access a service with more limited permissions, it can exchange its token for one with reduced or more specific scopes.

== What's new? 🆕

- ✅ Official support (no longer a preview feature)
- 📘 Compliance with RFC 8693 (OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange)
- 🖱️ Simple configuration via the Admin Console (just a switch in client settings)
- 🛡️ Integration with Client Policies to enforce custom rules. You can restrict exchanges to specific clients, or deny exchanges based on requested scopes.

== How to get started 🚀

If you're using Keycloak 26.2 or later, there's nothing extra to enable. Token Exchange is ready to use, just open the client settings in the admin console and enable the dedicated switch.

If you're still using the preview feature of token exchange, check the https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/upgrading/index.html#supported-standard-token-exchange[migration guide] and the https://www.keycloak.org/securing-apps/token-exchange#_standard-token-exchange-comparison[comparison] to understand the differences and plan your migration.

📄 For full setup instructions and configuration details, refer to the https://www.keycloak.org/securing-apps/token-exchange#_standard-token-exchange[official documentation].

== What’s next? 🔍

We’re continuing to expand Token Exchange support with future enhancements such as:

- 🔄 Exchanging tokens issued by external identity providers
- 👤 Using token exchange to impersonate users

Stay tuned for updates in upcoming releases.
