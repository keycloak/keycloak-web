:summary: With Keycloak 26.4 DPoP is now officially supported

DPoP has been available in Keycloak since version 23.0.0, but only as a preview feature. With the release of
**Keycloak 26.4**, we're happy to share that **OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession (DPoP) is now officially supported**.

== What is DPoP? üîë
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9449[DPoP] is a Proof-of-Possession mechanism that improves OAuth token security by binding a token (access or refresh) to a public/private key pair controlled by the client. By requiring a signed DPoP proof with each request,
DPoP ensures that a stolen bearer token cannot be used without possession of the associated private key. This significantly improves token security in
distributed systems.

== What‚Äôs New for DPoP in 26.4 üÜï

DPoP is now a supported feature and includes some improvements and minor capabilities:

- Support for all Keycloak endpoints that accept bearer tokens, including the Admin REST API and the Account API.
- Option to bind *only refresh tokens* for public clients, while leaving access tokens as bearer if required.
- Ability to request the `dpop_jkt` parameter in OIDC authorization requests.

For full details, see the
https://www.keycloak.org/docs/26.4.0/server_admin/#_dpop-bound-tokens[official documentation].

== How to enable and use DPoP in Keycloak üöÄ

If you want to force a client to use DPoP, you need to enable the *Require DPoP bound tokens* switch in the Admin Console Settings tab under Capability config.

If *Require DPoP bound tokens* is off, the client can still send a DPoP proof in the token request. In that case, Keycloak verifies it and adds the thumbprint to the token, but DPoP binding is not enforced.

== Try It Out üîç

If you want to experiment with DPoP in practice, you can try it out using the
https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-playground/tree/main/fapi-playground[Keycloak FAPI Playground],
which includes example client configurations and test flows that demonstrate how DPoP works end-to-end.
