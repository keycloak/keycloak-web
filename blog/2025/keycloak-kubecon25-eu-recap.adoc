Keycloak had a very active presence at this year's KubeCon EU in London. This blog presents a few of the
highlights as well as ways you can contribute to Keycloak’s CNCF journey.

== Project Pavilion

Keycloak hosted a project pavilion stand during Wednesday, Thursday and Friday afternoon slots. Attending the booth were
Keycloak contributors https://github.com/tnorimat[Takashi Norimatsu] and https://github.com/y-tabata[Yoshiyuki Tabata] from Hitachi,
alongside https://github.com/mabartos[Martin Bartos] and https://github.com/ryanemerson[Ryan Emerson] from Red Hat.

During these sessions, we had the opportunity to connect with both existing and prospective Keycloak users to talk all
things related to Identity and Access Management. Keycloak stickers were as popular as ever, with both the CNCF sticker
wall and our own stash completely emptied! It was fantastic to hear firsthand feedback - what’s working well and where
there’s room for improvement. Insights like these are invaluable as we continue to grow the project and shape the future
roadmap. If you weren’t able to stop by the pavilion, we’d still love to hear from you, please feel free to share your
thoughts via the http://bit.ly/keycloak-community[online feedback form].
