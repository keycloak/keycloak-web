This is a huge moment for all of us! ðŸš€ðŸŽ‰

Reaching *30,000 stars* on GitHub is not just another number â€” it is a powerful signal of how far Keycloak has come, how much trust the community has placed in it, and how essential it has become in the world of open source Identity and Access Management (IAM).

*30,000 stars* is a testament to a thriving global community, the trust of developers and enterprises, and Keycloakâ€™s place as the go-to open source solution for securing apps and services.
It is a milestone that reflects years of collaboration, contribution, and community passion â€” and we couldnâ€™t be prouder.

Weâ€™re deeply grateful to our users and contributors whose support and contributions turned this milestone into reality â€” *this wouldnâ€™t have been possible without you!*

As seen on the graph below, Keycloak just keeps getting more and more love on GitHub, with stars growing faster every year.
It is clear that more people are discovering and relying on it for their IAM needs.

Keycloak is on a great track and the community momentum is stronger than ever. ðŸš€
