<h4 id="_dpop_supported">DPoP (supported)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keycloak has support for OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer (DPoP), which was a preview feature since Keycloak 23. Also, the supported version includes some improvements and minor capabilities of the DPoP feature such as the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Possibility to make only refresh tokens of a public client to be DPoP bound and omit the binding of an access token.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All Keycloak endpoints that are secured by bearer token can now handle DPoP tokens. This includes, for example, the Admin REST API and Account REST API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Possibility to require the <code>dpop_jkt</code> parameter in the OIDC authentication request.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="_federated_client_authentication_preview">Federated client authentication (preview)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Identity providers are now able to federate client authentication. This allows clients to authenticate with SPIFFE JWT SVIDs,
Kubernetes service account tokens, or tokens issued by an OpenID Connect identity provider.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This feature is currently preview, and expected to become supported in 26.5.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_automatic_certificate_management_for_saml_clients">Automatic certificate management for SAML clients</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The SAML clients can now be configured to automatically download the signing and encrypting certificates from the SP entity metadata descriptor endpoint. In order to use this new feature, in the client <strong>Settings</strong> tab, section <strong>Signature and Encryption</strong>, configure the <strong>Metadata descriptor URL</strong> option (the URL where the SP metadata information with the certificates is published) and activate <strong>Use metadata descriptor URL</strong>. The certificates will be automatically downloaded and cached in the <code>public-key-storage</code> SPI from that URL.
This also allows for seamless rotation of certificates.</p>

<h4 id="_serving_as_an_authorization_server_in_mcp">Serving as an authorization server in MCP</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open-source standard for connecting AI applications to external systems. Using MCP, AI applications can connect to data sources, tools and workflows enabling them to access key information and perform tasks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To comply with MCP specification, this version provides its OAuth 2.0 Server Metadata via a well-known URI whose format complies with RFC 8414 OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata specification. Therefore, Keycloak users can now use Keycloak as an authorization server for MCP.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The latest MCP specification 2025-06-18 additionally requires support for resource indicators which are currently not implemented in Keycloak.</p>

<h4 id="_optional_email_domain_for_organizations">Optional email domain for organizations</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In earlier versions, each organization required at least one email domain, which was a limitation for some scenarios.
Starting with this release, an email domain is optional.
Thank you to <a href="https://github.com/SferaDev">Alexis Rico</a> for contributing this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When no domain is specified, organization members will not be validated against domain restrictions during authentication and profile validation.</p>

<h4 id="_new_conditional_authenticator">New conditional authenticator</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>Conditional - credential</strong> is a new authenticator that checks if a specific credential type has been used (or not used) during the authentication process. This condition is related to the Passkeys feature. It is added by Keycloak to the default browser flow to skip 2FA in case a passkey was used to log in as the primary credential.</p>
</div>

<h4 id="_enhancements_for_single_cluster_and_multi_cluster_setups">Enhancements for single-cluster and multi-cluster setups</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This release renamed multi-site to multi-cluster.
The updated documentation describes
how Keycloak clusters can be optionally distributed across multiple availability-zones within a region for increased availability.
The Keycloak Operator now deploys Keycloak across multiple availability zones within a Kubernetes cluster by default. Keycloak also detects split-brains within a cluster.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This change should provide better availability for users who are running Keycloak in Kubernetes clusters that span multiple availability zones.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_support_for_additional_databases_and_versions">Support for additional databases and versions</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With this release, we added support for the following new database vendors:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>EnterpriseDB (EDB) Advanced 17.6</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Where the previous documentation stated only tested database version, it now states all the supported database versions as well.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_expose_management_interface_via_http">Expose management interface via HTTP</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Previous versions exposed the management endpoint only via HTTPS when the main interface was using HTTPS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Set the new option <code>http-management-scheme</code> to <code>http</code> to have the management interface use HTTP rather than inheriting the HTTPS settings of the main interface.
This allows monitoring those endpoints in environments where no TLS client is available.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_expose_health_endpoints_on_the_main_https_port">Expose health endpoints on the main HTTP(S) port</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With <code>health-enabled</code> set to true, you may set the <code>http-management-health-enabled</code> to <code>false</code> to indicate that health endpoints should be exposed on the main HTTP(s) port instead of the
management port. When this option is <code>false</code> you should block unwanted external traffic to <code>/health</code> at your proxy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This allows using the health endpoints in environments where the load balancer might need access to those ports to direct traffic to the correct nodes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_specify_a_tlssecret_on_the_keycloak_cr_ingress_spec">Specify a <code>tlsSecret</code> on the Keycloak CR <code>ingress</code> spec</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To support basic TLS termination (edge) deployments by the operator, you may now set the Keycloak CR <code>spec.ingress.tlsSecret</code> field to a TLS Secret name in the namespace.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_additional_datasources_configuration_supported">Additional datasources configuration (supported)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some Keycloak use cases like User Federation might require connecting to additional databases.
This was possible only through specifying unsupported raw Quarkus properties in previous Keycloak versions. In this release, there are now dedicated server options for additional datasources. This allows users to leverage additional databases in their extensions in a supported and user-friendly way.</p>

<h3 id="_observability">Observability</h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_operator_creates_a_servicemonitor_automatically">Operator creates a ServiceMonitor automatically</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Operator now provisions a <code>ServiceMonitor</code> for the management endpoint if metrics are enabled and the
<code>monitoring.coreos.com/v1:ServiceMonitor</code> Custom Resource Definition is present on the Kubernetes cluster. The
specification of the <code>ServiceMonitor</code> takes into account the various management endpoint configurations, to ensure that
metrics can be scraped without any additional configuration. If you do not want a <code>ServiceMonitor</code> to be created, you can disable
this by setting <code>spec.serviceMonitor.enabled: false</code>. For more details, see the <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/guides#operator">Operator  Guide</a>.</p>

<h4 id="_http_access_logging_of_incoming_http_requests">HTTP access logging of incoming HTTP requests</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keycloak supports HTTP access logging to record details of incoming HTTP requests.
While access logs are often used for debugging and traffic analysis, they are also important for security auditing and compliance monitoring.</p>

<h4 id="_showing_context_information_in_log_messages_preview">Showing context information in log messages (preview)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can now add context information via the mapped diagnostic context (MDC) to each log message like the realm or the client that initiated the request.
This helps you to track down a warning or error message in the log to a specific caller or environment
