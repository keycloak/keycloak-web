<p>Read on to learn more about each new feature, and <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/upgrading/index.html">find additional details in the upgrading guide</a> if you are upgrading from a previous release of Keycloak.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_recovering_your_account_if_you_lose_your_2fa_credentials">Recovering your account if you lose your 2FA credentials</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When using for example a one-time-password (OTP) generators as a second factor for authenticating users (2FA), a user can get locked out of their account when they, for example, lose their phone that contains the OTP generator.
To prepare for such a case, the recovery codes feature allows users to print a set of recovery codes as an additional second factor.
If the recovery codes are then allowed as an alternative 2FA in the login flow, they can be used instead of the OTP generated passwords.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With this release, the recovery codes feature is promoted from preview to a supported feature.
For newly created realms, the browser flow now includes the Recovery Authentication Code Form as <em>Disabled</em>, and it can be switched to <em>Alternative</em> by admins if they want to use this feature.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For more information about this 2FA method, see the <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/docs/26.3.0/server_admin/#_recovery-codes">Recovery Codes</a> chapter in the Server Administration Guide.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_performance_improvements_to_import_export_and_migration">Performance improvements to import, export and migration</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The time it takes to run imports, exports or migrations involving a large number of realms has been improved. There is no longer a cumulative performance degradation for each additional realm processed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_simplified_registration_for_webauthn_and_passkeys">Simplified registration for WebAuthn and Passkeys</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both WebAuthn Register actions (<code>webauthn-register</code> and <code>webauthn-register-passwordless</code>) which are also used for Passkeys now support a parameter <code>skip_if_exists</code> when initiated by the application (AIA).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This should make it more convenient to use the AIA in scenarios where a user has already set up WebAuthn or Passkeys.
The parameter allows skipping the action if the user already has a credential of that type.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For more information, see the <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/docs/26.3.0/server_admin/#_webauthn_aia">Registering WebAuthn credentials using AIA</a> chapter in the Server Administration Guide.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_simplified_linking_of_the_user_account_to_an_identity_provider">Simplified linking of the user account to an identity provider</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Client-initiated linking a user account to the identity provider is now based on application-initiated action (AIA) implementation.
This functionality aligns configuring this functionality and simplifies the error handling the calling of the client application,
making it more useful for a broader audience.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The custom protocol, which was previously used for client-initiated account linking, is now deprecated.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_brokering_with_oauth_v2_compliant_authorization_servers">Brokering with OAuth v2 compliant authorization servers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In previous releases Keycloak already supported federation with other OpenID Connect and SAML providers, as well as with several Social Providers like GitHub and Google which are based on OAuth 2.0.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The new OAuth 2.0 broker now closes the gap to federate with any OAuth 2.0 provider.
This then allows you to federate, for example, with Amazon or other providers.
As this is a generic provider, you will need to specify the different claims and a user info endpoint in the provider&#8217;s configuration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For more information, see the <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/docs/26.3.0/server_admin/#_identity_broker_oauth">OAuth v2 identity providers</a> chapter in the Server Administration Guide.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_trusted_email_verification_when_brokering_openid_connect_providers">Trusted email verification when brokering OpenID Connect Providers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Until now, the OpenID Connect broker did not support the standard <code>email_verified</code> claim available from the ID Tokens issued by OpenID Connect Providers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Starting with this release, Keycloak supports this standard claim as defined by the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims">OpenID Connect Core Specification</a> for federation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whenever users are federated for the first time or re-authenticating and if the <strong>Trust email</strong> setting is enabled, <strong>Sync Mode</strong> is set to <code>FORCE</code> and the provider sends the <code>email_verified</code> claim, the user account will have their email marked according to the <code>email_verified</code> claim.
If the provider does not send the claim, it defaults to the original behavior and sets the email as verified.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_asynchronous_logging_for_higher_throughput_and_lower_latency">Asynchronous logging for higher throughput and lower latency</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All available log handlers now support asynchronous logging capabilities.
Asynchronous logging helps deployments that require high throughput and low latency.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For more details on this opt-in feature, see the <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/server/logging">Logging guide</a>.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_rolling_updates_for_patch_releases_for_minimized_downtime_preview">Rolling updates for patch releases for minimized downtime (preview)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the previous release, the Keycloak Operator was enhanced to support performing rolling updates of the Keycloak image if both images contain the same version.
This is useful, for example, when switching to an optimized image, changing a theme or a provider source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this release, we extended this to perform rolling update when the new image contains a future patch release from the same <code>major.minor</code> release stream as a preview feature.
This can reduce the service&#8217;s downtime even further, as downtime is only needed when upgrading from a different minor or major version.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_passkeys_integrated_in_the_default_username_forms">Passkeys integrated in the default username forms</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this release Keycloak integrates <strong>Passkeys</strong> in the default authentications forms. A new switch <strong>Enable Passkeys</strong> is available in the configuration, <strong>Authentication</strong> → <strong>Policies</strong> → <strong>Webauthn Passwordless Policy</strong>, that seamlessly incorporates passkeys support to the realm. With just one click, Keycloak offers conditional and modal user interfaces in the default login forms to allow users to authenticate with a passkey.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>Passkeys</strong> feature is still in preview. Follow the <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/server/features">Enabling and disabling features</a> guide to enable it.</p>
