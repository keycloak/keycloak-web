</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For OAuth 2.0/OIDC, this includes removal of the Tomcat adapter, WildFly/EAP adapter, Servlet Filter adapter, <code>KeycloakInstalled</code> desktop adapter, the <code>jaxrs-oauth-client</code> adapter, JAAS login modules, Spring adapter and SpringBoot adapters.
You can check <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2023/03/adapter-deprecation-update.html">our older post</a> for the list of some alternatives.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The generic Authorization Client library is still supported, and we still plan to support it. It aims to be used in combination with any other OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect libraries. You can
check the <a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-quickstarts">quickstarts</a> for some examples where this authorization client library is used together with the 3rd party Java adapters like

<h3 id="_argon2_password_hashing">Argon2 password hashing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Argon2 is now the default password hashing algorithm used by Keycloak in a non-FIPS environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Argon2 was the winner of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_Hashing_Competition">2015 password hashing competition</a>
and is the recommended hashing algorithm by <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#argon2id">OWASP</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Keycloak 24 the default hashing iterations for PBKDF2 were increased from 27.5K to 210K, resulting in a more than
10 times increase in the amount of CPU time required to generate a password hash. With Argon2 it is possible to achieve
better security, with almost the same CPU time as previous releases of Keycloak. One downside is Argon2 requires more
memory, which is a requirement to be resistant against GPU attacks. The defaults for Argon2 in Keycloak requires 7MB
per-hashing request.
To prevent excessive memory and CPU usage, the parallel computation of hashes by Argon2 is by default limited to the number of cores available to the JVM.
To support the memory intensive nature of Argon2, we have updated the default GC from ParallelGC to G1GC for a better heap utilization.</p>

<p>The Keycloak 23 release provided improvements for when a user is authenticated in parallel in multiple browser tabs. However, this improvement did not address the case when an authentication session
expired. Now for the case when user is already logged-in in one browser tab and an authentication session expired in other browser tabs, Keycloak is able to redirect back to the client
application with an OIDC/SAML error, so the client application can immediately retry authentication, which should usually automatically log in the application because of the SSO session. For more

<p>Claims <code>sub</code> and <code>auth_time</code> are added by protocol mappers now, which are configured by default on the new client scope <code>basic</code>, which is added automatically to all the clients. The claims are still added to the ID token and access token as before, but not to lightweight access token.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Claim <code>nonce</code> is added only to the ID token now.  It is not added to a regular access token or lightweight access token. For backwards compatibility, you can add this claim to an access token by protocol mapper, which needs to be explicitly configured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Claim <code>session_state</code> is not added to any token now. It is still possible to add it by protocol mapper if needed.

It supports setting <strong>Maximum Age of Authentication</strong>, which is the maximum time users can update their password
by the <code>kc_action</code> parameter (used for instance when updating password in the Account Console) without re-authentication. The sorting of required actions is also improved. When there are multiple required
actions during authentication, all actions are sorted together regardless of whether those are actions set during authentication (for instance by the <code>kc_action</code> parameter) or actions added to the user account manually by an administrator.
