<p>Keycloak upgraded to version 3.2.0.Final of the Quarkus Java framework.
Quarkus 3.x continues the tradition of propelling Java development by moving fast and providing a cutting-edge user experience with the latest technologies.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_transition_from_java_ee_to_jakarta_ee">Transition from Java EE to Jakarta EE</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As part of upgrading to Quarkus 3.x Keycloak migrated its codebase from Java EE (Enterprise Edition) to its successor Jakarta EE, which brings various changes into Keycloak.
We have upgraded all Jakarta EE specifications in order to support Jakarta EE 10.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to provide a better runtime and leverage as much as possible the underlying stack,
all injection points for contextual data using the <code>javax.ws.rs.core.Context</code> annotation were removed. The expected improvement
in performance involves no longer creating proxies instances multiple times during the request lifecycle, and drastically reducing the amount of reflection code at runtime.</p>

<h4 id="_elytron_credential_store_replacement">Elytron credential store replacement</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The previous and now removed WildFly distribution provided a built-in vault provider that reads secrets from a keystore-backed Elytron credential store. As this is no longer available, we have added a new implementation of the Keycloak Vault SPI called Keycloak KeyStore Vault. As the name suggests, this implementation reads secrets from a Java keystore file. Such secrets can be then used within multiple places of the Administration Console. For further details, see <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/server/vault">our guide</a> and the latest <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#_vault-administration">documentation</a>.</p>

<h4 id="_keystore_config_source_added">KeyStore Config Source added</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In relation to the KeyStore Vault news, we also integrated Quarkus&#8217;s recently released feature called KeyStore Config Source. This means that among the already existing configuration sources (CLI parameters, environment variables and files), you can now configure your Keycloak server via configuration properties stored in a Java keystore file. You can learn more about this feature in the <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/server/configuration">Configuration guide</a>.</p>

<h4 id="_account_console_v3_promoted_to_preview">Account Console v3 promoted to preview</h4>

<h4 id="_account_console_template_variables_removed">Account Console template variables removed</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two of the variables exposed to the Account Console V2 and V3 templates (<code>isEventsEnabled</code> and <code>isTotpConfigured</code>) were left unused, and have been removed in this release.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is possible that if a developer extended the Account Console theme, he or she could make use of these variables. So make sure that these variables are no longer used if you are extending the base theme.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_changes_to_custom_admin_console_messages">Changes to custom Admin Console messages</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Admin Console (and soon also the new Account Console) works slightly different than the rest of Keycloak in regards to how keys for internationalized messages are parsed. This is due to the fact that it uses the <a href="https://www.i18next.com/">i18next</a> library for internationalization. Therefore when defining custom messages for the Admin Console under "Realm Settings" âž¡ "Localization" best practices for i18next must be taken into account. Specifically, when defining a message for the Admin Console it is it important to specify a <a href="https://www.i18next.com/principles/namespaces">namespace</a> in the key of your message.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, let&#8217;s assume we want to overwrite the <a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/blob/025778fe9c745316f80b53fe3052aeb314e868ef/js/apps/admin-ui/public/locales/en/dashboard.json#L3"><code>welcome</code></a> message shown to the user when a new realm has been created. This message is located in the <code>dashboard</code> namespace, same as the name of the original file that holds the messages (<code>dashboard.json</code>). If we wanted to overwrite this message we&#8217;ll have to use the namespace as a prefix followed by the key of the message separated by a colon, in this case it would become <code>dashboard:welcome</code>.</p>

<h4 id="_required_to_be_instantiated_with_the_new_operator">Required to be instantiated with the <code>new</code> operator</h4>

<p>In a previous release we started to actively log deprecation warnings when the Keycloak JS adapter is constructed without the <code>new</code> operator. Starting this release doing so will throw an exception instead. This is to align with the expected behavior of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes">JavaScript classes</a>, which will allow further refactoring of the adapter in the future.</p>

<p>The condition status field was changed from a boolean to a string for conformance with standard Kubernetes conditions.

If your modifications prevent the operator from being able to manage the resource, there Keycloak CR will show this error condition and the operator will log it.</p>
