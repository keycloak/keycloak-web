<h3 id="_transport_stack_jdbc_ping_as_new_default">Transport stack <code>jdbc-ping</code> as new default</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keycloak now uses by default its database to discover other nodes of the same cluster, which removes the need of additional network related configurations especially for cloud providers. It is also a default that will work out-of-the-box in cloud environments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Previous versions of Keycloak used as a default UDP multicast to discover other nodes to form a cluster and to synchronize the replicated caches of Keycloak.
This required multicast to be available and to be configured correctly, which is usually not the case in cloud environments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Starting with this version, the default changes to the <code>jdbc-ping</code> configuration which uses Keycloak&#8217;s database to discover other nodes.
As this removes the need for multicast network capabilities and UDP and no longer using dynamic ports for the TCP-based failure detection, this is a simplification and a drop-in replacement for environments which used the previous default.
To enable the previous behavior, choose the transport stack <code>udp</code> which is now deprecated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Keycloak Operator will continue to configure <code>kubernetes</code> as a transport stack.</p>

<h3 id="_virtual_threads_enabled_for_infinispan_and_jgroups_thread_pools">Virtual Threads enabled for Infinispan and JGroups thread pools</h3>

<p>Starting from this release, Keycloak automatically enables the virtual thread pool support in both the embedded Infinispan and JGroups  when running on OpenJDK 21.
This removes the need to configure the JGroups thread pool, the need to align the JGroups thread pool with the HTTP worker thread pool, and reduces the overall memory footprint.</p>

Initiating user registration was already supported in Keycloak with the use of dedicated endpoint <code>/realms/&lt;realm&gt;/protocol/openid-connect/registrations</code>.
However, this endpoint is now deprecated in favor of the standard way as it was a proprietary solution specific to Keycloak.</p>

<p>The OIDC authentication request supports a limited number of additional custom parameters of maximum length. The additional parameters can be
used for custom purposes (for example, adding the claims into the token with the use of the protocol mappers). In the previous versions, the maximum count of
the parameters was hardcoded to 5 and the maximum length of the parameters was hardcoded to 2000. Now both values are configurable. Additionally it can be possible to configure
if additional parameters cause a request to fail or if parameters are ignored.</p>

<p>The <strong>Condition - sub-flow executed</strong> and <strong>Condition - client scope</strong> are new conditional authenticators in Keycloak. The condition <strong>Condition - sub-flow executed</strong> checks if a previous sub-flow was
executed (or not executed) successfully during the authentication flow execution. The condition <strong>Condition - client scope</strong> checks if a configured client scope is present as a client scope of the
client requesting authentication. For more details, see <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/docs/26.1.0/server_admin/#conditions-in-conditional-flows">Conditions in conditional flows</a>.</p>

<h3 id="_dark_mode_enabled_for_the_welcome_theme">Dark mode enabled for the welcome theme</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve now enabled dark mode support for all the <code>keycloak</code> themes. This feature was previously present in the admin console, account console and login, and is now also available on the welcome page. If a user indicates their preference through an operating system setting (e.g. light or dark mode) or a user agent setting, the theme will automatically follow these preferences.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are using a custom theme that extends any of the <code>keycloak</code> themes and are not yet ready to support dark mode, or have styling conflicts that prevent you from implementing dark mode, you can disable support by adding the following property to your theme:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-properties" data-lang="properties">darkMode=false</code></pre>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The format of <code>AUTH_SESSION_ID</code> cookie was updated to include a signature of the auth session id to ensure its integrity through signature verification. The new format is <code>base64(auth_session_id.auth_session_id_signature)</code>. With this update, the old format will no longer be accepted, meaning that old auth sessions will no longer be valid. This change has no impact on user sessions.</p>

The desired default behaviour is for Keycloak pages to not show up in search engine results and this is accomplished by the existing <code>X-Robots-Tag</code> header, which is set to <code>none</code> by default. The value of this header can be overridden per-realm if a different behaviour is needed.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The key providers that allow to import externally generated keys (<code>rsa</code> and <code>java-keystore</code> factories) now check the validity of the associated certificate if present. Therefore a key with a certificate that is expired cannot be imported in Keycloak anymore. If the certificate expires at runtime, the key is converted into a passive key (enabled but not active). A passive key is not used for new tokens, but it is still valid for validating previous issued tokens.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The default <code>generated</code> key providers generate a certificate valid for 10 years (the types that have or can have an associated certificate). Because of the long validity and the recommendation to rotate keys frequently, the generated providers do not perform this check.</p>
