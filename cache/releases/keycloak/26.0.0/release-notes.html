<p>Keycloak 25 introduced the feature <code>persistent-user-sessions</code>. With this feature enabled all user sessions are persisted in the database as opposed to the previous behavior where only offline sessions were persisted.
In Keycloak 26, this feature is enabled by default. This means that all user sessions are persisted in the database by default.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is possible to revert this behavior to the previous state by disabling the feature. Follow the <code>Volatile user sessions</code> section in <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/server/caching">Configuring distributed caches</a> guide for more details.</p>

<p>Keycloak 26 introduces significant improvements to the recommended HA multi-site architecture, most notably:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Keycloak deployments are now able to handle user requests simultaneously in both sites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Active monitoring of the connectivity between the sites is now required to update the replication between the sites in case of a failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The loadbalancer blueprint has been updated to use the AWS Global Accelerator as this avoids prolonged fail-over times caused by DNS caching by clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persistent user sessions are now a requirement of the architecture. Consequently, user sessions will be kept
on Keycloak or Infinispan upgrades.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the past, regaining access to a Keycloak instance when all admin users were locked out was a challenging and complex process. Recognizing these challenges and aiming to significantly enhance the user experience, Keycloak now offers several straightforward methods to bootstrap a temporary admin account and recover lost admin access.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is now possible to run the <code>start</code> or <code>start-dev</code> commands with specific options to create a temporary admin account. Additionally, a new dedicated command has been introduced, which allows users to regain admin access without hassle.</p>

<p>Lightweight access tokens can now be used on the admin REST API. The <code>security-admin-console</code> and <code>admin-cli</code> clients are now using lightweight access tokens by default, so “Always Use Lightweight Access Token” and “Full Scope Allowed” are now enabled on these two clients.

<h3 id="_keycloak_javascript_adapter_now_standalone">Keycloak JavaScript adapter now standalone</h3>

<p>Keycloak JavaScript adapter is now a standalone library and is therefore no longer served statically from the Keycloak server. The goal is to de-couple the library from the Keycloak server, so that it can be refactored independently, simplifying the code and making it easier to maintain in the future. Additionally, the library is now free of third-party dependencies, which makes it more lightweight and easier to use in different environments.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The same applies to the management interface when the <code>http-management-relative-path</code> or <code>http-relative-path</code> property is specified.</p>

<p>The <code>java-keystore</code> key provider, which allows loading a realm key from an external java keystore file, has been modified to manage all Keycloak algorithms. Besides, the keystore and key secrets, needed to retrieve the actual key from the store, can be configured using the <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/docs/26.0.0/server_admin/#_vault-administration">vault</a>. Therefore a Keycloak realm can externalize any key to the encrypted file without sensitive data stored in the database.</p>

<p>Now Keycloak allows configuring ECDH-ES, ECDH-ES+A128KW, ECDH-ES+A192KW or ECDH-ES+A256KW as the encryption key management algorithm for clients. The Key Agreement with Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral Static (ECDH-ES) specification introduces three new header parameters for the JWT: <code>epk</code>, <code>apu</code> and <code>apv</code>. Currently Keycloak implementation only manages the compulsory <code>epk</code> while the other two (which are optional) are never added to the header.
