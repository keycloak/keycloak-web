<h4 id="_more_flexibility_for_introspection_endpoint">More flexibility for introspection endpoint</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In previous versions, introspection endpoint  automatically returned most claims, which were available in the access token. Now there is new
switch <code>Add to token introspection</code> on most of protocol mappers. This addition allows more flexibility as introspection endpoint can return different
claims than access token. This is first step towards "Lightweight access tokens" support as access tokens can omit lots of the claims, which would be still returned
by the introspection endpoint. When migrating from previous versions, the introspection endpoint should return same claims, which are returned from access token,
so the behavior should be effectively the same by default after the migration. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/skabano">Shigeyuki Kabano</a> for the contribution.</p>

<p>Keycloak has preview support for <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">Passkeys</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Passkey registration and authentication are realized by the features of WebAuthn.
Therefore, users of Keycloak can do passkey registration and authentication by existing WebAuthn registration and authentication.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both synced passkeys and device-bound passkeys can be used for both Same-Device and Cross-Device Authentication.
However, passkeys operations success depends on the user&#8217;s environment. Make sure which operations can succeed in <a href="https://passkeys.dev/device-support/">the environment</a>.
Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tnorimat">Takashi Norimatsu</a> for the contribution and thanks to <a href="https://github.com/thomasdarimont">Thomas Darimont</a> for the help with the

<h4 id="_you_are_already_logged_in">You are already logged-in</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There was an infamous issue that when user had login page opened in multiple browser tabs and authenticated in one of them,
the attempt to authenticate in subsequent browser tabs opened the page <code>You are already logged-in</code>. This is improved now as
other browser tabs just automatically authenticate as well after authentication of first browser tab. There are still
corner cases when the behaviour is not 100% correct, like the scenario with expired authentication session, which is then
restarted just in one browser tab and hence other browser tabs won&#8217;t follow automatically with the login.
So we still plan improvements in this area.</p>

<h4 id="_password_policy_for_specify_maximum_authentication_time">Password policy for specify Maximum authentication time</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keycloak supports new password policy, which allows to specify the maximum age of an authentication with which a password may be changed by user without re-authentication.
When this password policy is set to 0, the user will be required to re-authenticate to change the  password in the Account Console or by other means.
You can also specify a lower or higher value than the default value of 5 minutes. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/thomasdarimont">Thomas Darimont</a> for the contribution.</p>

SPI&#8217;s that depend directly on JAX-RS API should be compatible with this change. SPI&#8217;s that depend on RESTEasy Classic including <code>ResteasyClientBuilder</code> will not be compatible and will require update, this will also be true for other implementation of the JAX-RS API like Jersey.</p>
