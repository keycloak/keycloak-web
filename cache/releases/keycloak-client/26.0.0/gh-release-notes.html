<div class="paragraph">
<p>From this release, some of the Keycloak client libraries will have release cycle independent of the Keycloak server release cycle. The 26.0.0 release may be the last one
when the client libraries are released together with the Keycloak server. But from now on, the client libraries may be released at a different time than the Keycloak server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The client libraries are these artifacts:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Java admin client - Maven artifact <code>org.keycloak:keycloak-admin-client</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Java authorization client - Maven artifact <code>org.keycloak:keycloak-authz-client</code></p>
