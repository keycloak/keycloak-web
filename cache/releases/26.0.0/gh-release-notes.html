<h4 id="_dedicated_release_cycle_for_the_client_libraries">Dedicated release cycle for the client libraries</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From this release, some of the Keycloak client libraries will have release cycle independent of the Keycloak server release cycle. The 26.0.0 release may be the last one
when the client libraries are released together with the Keycloak server. But from now on, the client libraries may be released at a different time than the Keycloak server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The client libraries are these artifacts:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Java admin client - Maven artifact <code>org.keycloak:keycloak-admin-client</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Java authorization client - Maven artifact <code>org.keycloak:keycloak-authz-client</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Java policy enforcer - Maven artifact <code>org.keycloak:keycloak-policy-enforcer</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is possible that in the future, some more libraries will be included.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The client libraries are supported with Java 8, so it is possible to use them with the client applications deployed on the older application servers.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_compatibility_of_the_client_libraries_with_the_server">Compatibility of the client libraries with the server</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Beginning with this release, we are testing and supporting client libraries with the same server version and a few previous major server versions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For details about supported versions of client libraries with server versions, see the <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/docs/26.0.0/upgrading/#_upgrade_client_libraries">Upgrading Guide</a>.</p>

<h3 id="_user_sessions_persisted_by_default">User sessions persisted by default</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keycloak 25 introduced the feature <code>persistent-user-sessions</code>. With this feature enabled all user sessions are persisted in the database as opposed to the previous behavior where only offline sessions were persisted.
In Keycloak 26, this feature is enabled by default. This means that all user sessions are persisted in the database by default.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is possible to revert this behavior to the previous state by disabling the feature. Follow the <code>Volatile user sessions</code> section in <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/server/caching">Configuring distributed caches</a> guide for more details.</p>

<h3 id="_new_default_login_theme">New default login theme</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is now a new version (<code>v2</code>) of the <code>keycloak</code> login theme, which provides an improved look and feel, including support for switching automatically to a dark theme based on user preferences.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The previous version (<code>v1</code>) is now deprecated, and will be removed in a future release.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For all new realms, <code>keycloak.v2</code> will be the default login theme.  Also, any existing realm that never explicitly set a login theme will be switched to <code>keycloak.v2</code>.
= Highly available multi-site deployments</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keycloak 26 introduces significant improvements to the recommended HA multi-site architecture, most notably:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Keycloak deployments are now able to handle user requests simultaneously in both sites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Active monitoring of the connectivity between the sites is now required to update the replication between the sites in case of a failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The loadbalancer blueprint has been updated to use the AWS Global Accelerator as this avoids prolonged fail-over times caused by DNS caching by clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persistent user sessions are now a requirement of the architecture. Consequently, user sessions will be kept
on Keycloak or Infinispan upgrades.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<h3 id="_admin_bootstrapping_and_recovery">Admin Bootstrapping and Recovery</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the past, regaining access to a Keycloak instance when all admin users were locked out was a challenging and complex process. Recognizing these challenges and aiming to significantly enhance the user experience, Keycloak now offers several straightforward methods to bootstrap a temporary admin account and recover lost admin access.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is now possible to run the <code>start</code> or <code>start-dev</code> commands with specific options to create a temporary admin account. Additionally, a new dedicated command has been introduced, which allows users to regain admin access without hassle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For detailed instructions and more information on this topic, refer to the <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/server/bootstrap-admin-recovery">Admin Bootstrap and Recovery</a> guide.</p>

<h3 id="_opentelemetry_tracing_preview">OpenTelemetry Tracing preview</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The underlying Quarkus support for OpenTelemetry Tracing has been exposed to Keycloak and allows obtaining application traces for better observability.
It helps to find performance bottlenecks, determine the cause of application failures, trace a request through the distributed system, and much more.
The support is in preview mode, and we would be happy to obtain any feedback.</p>

<h3 id="_openid_for_verifiable_credential_issuance">OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OID4VCI) is still an experimental feature in Keycloak, but it was greatly improved in this release. You will find significant development and discussions
in the <a href="https://github.com/keycloak/kc-sig-fapi">Keycloak OAuth SIG</a>. Anyone from the Keycloak community is welcome to join.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many thanks to all members of the OAuth SIG group for the participation on the development and discussions about this feature. Especially thanks to the

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The DPoP (OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession) preview feature has improvements. The DPoP is now supported for all grant types.
With previous releases, this feature was supported only for the <code>authorization_code</code> grant type. Support also exists for the DPoP token type on the UserInfo endpoint.</p>
