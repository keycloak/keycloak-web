<div class="paragraph">
<p>A regression was introduced in version <code>26.2.2</code> that caused URL fragments with path-style routing (e.g., <code>#/admin/maintenance/scripts</code>) to be URL-encoded after the OAuth callback, breaking applications that use hash-based routing. This issue affected Angular, React, and other applications that rely on the hash portion of the URL for client-side routing.</p>
