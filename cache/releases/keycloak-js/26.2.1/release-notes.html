<p>This release of Keycloak JS is the first release after our [initial announcement](<a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2025/02/keycloak-js-2620-released" class="bare">https://www.keycloak.org/2025/02/keycloak-js-2620-released</a>) to split if off from the main project release cycle. This release is the result of a large internal refactor to make the code more maintainable and make use of modern JavaScript language features, as well as to introduce a new test suite with more comprehensive test coverage. Even though much has changed under the hood, this is a patch releases, and there should be no breaking changes for users, only bugfixes and small enhancements.</p>
